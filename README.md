# JavaScript Projects

Welcome to the **JavaScript Projects Collection** – a curated set of frontend and full-stack mini projects built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and in some cases, backend technologies. This repository serves as a personal playground for learning and demonstrating core web development concepts.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a variety of web projects ranging from interactive UI elements to functional web tools and small applications. While many projects are **purely frontend**, some feature a **Node.js-based backend** to handle API requests, data processing, or file handling (e.g., Instagram Downloader).

This collection is created to:

- Strengthen frontend and backend development skills.
- Practice integrating JavaScript with real-world APIs.
- Build self-contained tools and applications.
- Serve as a reference and resource for learning and experimentation.

Each project is stored in its own folder with a clear structure and minimal dependencies to ensure ease of use and customization.
